# Claim Normalization using BART and T5

This repository showcases the development and implementation of advanced claim normalization techniques using state-of-the-art transformer architectures, specifically BART and T5, within Jupyter Notebooks.

## What I Did

- **Developed End-to-End Pipelines:** Built robust workflows for claim normalization, leveraging the power of BART and T5 models to process and standardize textual claims.
- **Applied Cutting-Edge NLP Methods:** Utilized modern transformer-based deep learning models for enhanced accuracy and contextual understanding in normalization tasks.
- **Experimentation and Evaluation:** Systematically experimented with different model configurations and data handling strategies to optimize performance.
- **Documentation and Reproducibility:** Ensured workflows are transparent and reproducible through well-structured notebooks, making it easy for others to follow or extend the methodology.

## Impact

- **Improved Claim Standardization:** The approach significantly elevates the consistency and reliability of claim normalization in NLP tasks, which is critical for downstream applications like information extraction, fact-checking, and automated reasoning.
- **Open Science Contribution:** By sharing these notebooks and pipelines, this project empowers other researchers and practitioners to adopt, customize, or benchmark against these solutions.
- **Foundation for Further Research:** The repository serves as a solid foundation for future work in claim normalization and related areas, enabling experimentation with additional models or datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development and experiment tracking
- **BART and T5 Transformers** for advanced NLP
